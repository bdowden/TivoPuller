TivoPuller
==========

A python-based scheduled app that will transfer tivo files off of a tivo into a directory. I hated how I had to manually wait for transfers to complete, limited by Tivo's 100MB network connection. Now I schedule this and everything is transferred by the time I get home from work! I can then transfer using a gigabit connection.
